### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparsion operators (`<` , `>`, `===` , etc.) in the node REPL, you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces.

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `available time` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.

```javascript
function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("hungry is", hungry);
  console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
}
```
